When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your
work local?
  When I work in a team or simply I need to backup my code.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
  Because I can work on a different version locally compared to the main version
  online and I don't want that my code (automaticcaly pushed) or others (automaticcaly
  pulled) breaks some other's code.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?
  I use fork in GitHub to create a copy of the repository into my GitHub profile.
  I use clone to get the repository from remote (eg GitHub) to my computer.
  I use branch to create different version of my app both in my computer and in remote repo.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
